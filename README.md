In this notebook, I use several methods compare the speed of numpy's built-in dot product versus a loop-based dot product. I visualize the results.

There are two versions of the notebook:
* One is the Jupyter Notebook: This version can be run on your own computer provided you have the correct packages. It was made using Anaconda 5.0.1. In the cell where I start to create the visualization, I define ```ord_mag = 6```. If you computer is slow, you may want to lower the order of magnitude to save time. If you computer is fast, you may get more interesting and complete results by raising it.
* The other an HTML file: This version will contain the timings from my computer and can be open easily.
